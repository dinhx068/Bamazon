It was very fun while doing this activity as I used the knowledge obtained from class and the internet of course. Follow the instructions below if you want to run the app yourself. There will be a link (later) to showcase how the app works.

Before using running the app do the following:
1. Do a "npm install" in your console while in the directory of the folder (to get all the packages of the app to work).
2. Next, if you have mysql, import and run the schema.sql file.
3. Then import and run the seeds.sql file.

How to use:
* to run the the customer app go to the console and run
    * node customerCustomer.js

* to run the manager app go to the console and run
    * node customerManager.js

Some things to possibly add/change.
